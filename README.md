# carry-select-adder

This code defines an entity called csa2 which represents a carry-select adder (CSA). It has generic parameter n which specifies the size of the input vectors A and B. It also has four ports: A, B, cin, and sum. A and B are both std_logic_vectors of size n bits, and cin is a single bit std_logic input. The output sum is also a std_logic_vector of size n+1 bits.

The entity csa2 has an associated architecture called arc_csa which defines the internal structure and behavior of the csa2 entity. The architecture contains a signal called cout which is a std_logic_vector of size 5 bits.

The architecture includes a series of instances of an entity called work.rca. These instances are labeled u1_1, u1_2, u2, u3, u4, and u5. Each of these instances represents a ripple-carry adder (RCA) entity, and they are used to perform the addition of the corresponding bits in the input vectors A and B. The generic map and port map statements specify the connections between the ports of the csa2 entity and the internal logic of the work.rca instances.

Finally, the output sum(n) is assigned the value of cout(5), which is the carry out from the final addition. This completes the sum of the n-bit inputs A and B with a carry-in of cin, and the result is stored in the sum output.
